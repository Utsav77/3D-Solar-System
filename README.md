# 3D-Solar-System
To make a 3-D  Solar System using python.
I have done this project using Vpython which is a library of python.
The main objective here was to make a more realistic solr system in which the planets should be rotating and revolving in the elliptical path continuosly.
Also i have converted the exact data (distance,radius etc) corresponding to acheive the more realistic view of solar system.
